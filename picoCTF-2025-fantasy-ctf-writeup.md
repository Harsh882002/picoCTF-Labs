ðŸ”Ž Understanding the Challenge

This is the introductory challenge of picoCTF. Its main purpose is not to test hacking skills, but:
Teach how to interact with terminal applications.
Familiarize players with CTF rules (e.g., donâ€™t share accounts/flags).
Guide players to find their first flag through a simple interactive game.
So the solution is straightforward, but the documentation should clearly capture every step with explanation<img width="1158" height="601" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e6228b5-a29c-4ab1-b52e-6068e867234f" />
