# picoCTF Labs & Write-ups

This repository contains my solutions and write-ups for challenges completed on **picoCTF**, an online Capture The Flag (CTF) platform for cybersecurity enthusiasts. The labs cover a wide range of topics including:

- Web Exploitation (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Cryptography (Cipher decryption, Hash cracking)
- Binary Exploitation & Reverse Engineering
- Forensics (Memory, Network, and File Analysis)
- Miscellaneous CTF challenges

Each challenge is documented with:

- Objective of the challenge
- Tools and commands used
- Step-by-step methodology
- Screenshots and outputs
- Flag obtained
- Key learnings and mitigation techniques (where applicable)

The purpose of this repository is to **demonstrate practical cybersecurity skills, problem-solving abilities, and hands-on experience** for penetration testing and CTF challenges. 

**Tools & Technologies Used:**  
Burp Suite, Ghidra, Nmap, Python, Wireshark, Hashcat, Linux/Windows command line
